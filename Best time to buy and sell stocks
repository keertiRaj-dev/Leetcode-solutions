/* You are given an array prices where prices[i] denotes the price of a stock on the ith day. You want to maximize the profit by buying a stock and then selling it at a higher price.

Suppose you can make a single buy and single sell at any date after you buy, what is the maximum profit that you can make?

Note: Return 0 if you cannot make a profit.

Examples
prices: [6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
Answer: 4 */

//Best  time to buy and sell stocks

var prices= [6,56 ,1, 4, 2, 5, 3,10, 29];

function stocks(arr){
    var track = {"minimum": arr[0], "profit": arr[1]-arr[0]};
    for (var i=1; i<arr.length; i++){
        if(arr[i]<track.minimum){
            track.minimum = arr[i]
        }
        if((arr[i]-track.minimum)>track.profit){
            track.profit = arr[i]-track.minimum;
        }
    }
    
    return track.profit;
